            <p>
                Hello! I am Nandini, the founder of Nandini's Art & Co! My dream is to help you celebrate any event with just the right decorations and cards. 
            </p>
            <p>I started making cards when I was 5 years old, and as you can imagine, they weren't very good. I would just write Happy Birthday on the outside of the card, and then a gift box and balloons that looked like a strangled person. But that's just typical 5 year old art. 
            </p>

            <p>
                As I grew older, my cards were slightly better, but still horrible. Nonetheless, my parents would always laugh and thank me for my cards, maybe because they thought it was cute. I started writing cheesy poems, now that I think about it, something like,
            </p>
            <span class="poem-line-one">    
                You're big and strong
            </span>
            <span class="poem-line-two"> 
                So let's sing along
            </span>
            <span class="poem-line-one"> 
                Today's your day
            </span>
            <span class="poem-line-two"> 
                Let's all say HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
            </span>
            <p>
                Cringe...
            </p>
            <p>
                Whenever I read this I feel really embarrassed, and I want to rip it up and throw it away. I knew I could do better than THAT.
            </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                I approached double digits, and soon, my teens, I took art classes from the best teacher in the world. She was so talented in art, patient, and, well, just amazing. I really enjoyed her art classes. I learned a few handy techniques from that class. I also started looking up some decoration ideas on YouTube and started implementing those in my cards. Now I would start writing jokes in the cards, make pop-ups, my drawings were kind of beautiful, I would make them interactive, and use styles that suit the person the card is for. Much better.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started discovering my other passions, though, when I was around 12. I enjoyed programming, learning Sanskrit, Indian classical music, and of course, art. I even have a calligraphy set, and a sketching set. Art was my way to relax.
            </p>
            <p>
                That was when I started thinking. Why not open up a company that sells cards, decorations, and other artwork? I knew Hallmark already existed, but I wanted this company to be my way. It would be a lot of work. Coming up with the designs, buying card stock and other materials, setting up a website, colors, brushes, photos, updating the website. Phew! I never really built on the idea, but then came when I turned 13. I really needed something to do, so I decided to pick up the idea. Why not? So here I am.
            </p>
            <p>
                I hope to keep improving my art to meet your satisfaction, and to all of those creative minds out there, keep it up!
            </p>
            <p>
                Build <span class="bold">YOUR</span> card, <span class="bold">YOUR</span> way.
            </p>
            <p>
                Happy celebrating!
            </p>
